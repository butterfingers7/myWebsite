I have worked with B2B E-commerce Start-up and gained exposure in multiple technology and business processes & industries with an understanding of emerging technologies \u2013 Full-Stack Development, Automation, Machine Learning, Supply Chain, Cloud, Data Analytics and Security. I have also completely owned technology products in multiple organisations.\n\n# Currently\n\nAfter wearing multiple hats ranging from Public relations, Product development to Data analytics, Data Science and Engineering, I found that what excites me the most is to see my own brainchild/vision create an impact at a vast level. \n\nSo, I have consciously decided to leave trivial route of working as an IT professional, and use my varied knowledge and experience to build products and run businesses. \n# Some things I am proud of\n\n- I graduated 10th and 12th with my percentile in the top 1% students.\n\n- I was a recipient of Chief Minister award and INSPIRE Scholarship in 2014.\n\n- I was the first female student ever to be nominated as a StuCCAn (member of 6-person committee that organises Oasis-BITS Pilani). \n\n- I did not miss a day of school from 2nd to 6th Standard. Talk about sincerity! \n\n- I am a good cook, and I aspire to retire with a 24x7 bakery/diner in the mountains.\n\n- I am always in the 'panic-zone', meaning that have this constant urge to try out new things, be it ideas, restaurants or ice cream flavors.\n\n- I am not scared of taking risks. That is what brings me the courage to switch from an existing promising career in IT, and step into Product Management.\n\n# What I do for fun\n\n- Eating (But something new everyday)\n- Cooking/Baking (I make amazing Banofee Pie)\n- Binge-watching (All time Favorites - Friends, Bojack Horseman, Fleabag, Modern Family, HIMYM)\n- Gardening ([watch my garden here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2120UF9EaKE)\n- Travel (Mountains over beaches)\n- Music (I love good ol' Indie music.
