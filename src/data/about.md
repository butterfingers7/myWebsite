# Intro

I graduated from Birla Institute of Technology & Science(BITS), Pilani - Pilani Campus in 2020.

2 years of experience in Product Development, UX Design and Data Analytics/Science. I have worked with B2B E-commerce Start-up and gained exposure in multiple technology and business processes & industries with an understanding of emerging technologies â€“ Full-Stack Development, Automation, Machine Learning, Supply Chain, Cloud, Data Analytics and Security. I have also completely owned technology products in multiple organisations.

# Currently

After wearing multiple hats ranging from Public relations, Product development to Data analytics, Data Science and Engineering, I found that what excites me the most is to see my own brainchild/vision create an impact at a vast level. 

So, I have consciously decided to leave trivial route of working as an IT professional, and use my varied knowledge and experience to build products and run businesses. 
# Some things I am proud of

- I graduated 10th and 12th with my percentile in the top 1% students.

- I was a recipient of Chief Minister award and INSPIRE Scholarship in 2014.

- I was the first female student ever to be nominated as a StuCCAn (member of 6-person committee that organises Oasis-BITS Pilani). 

- I did not miss a day of school from 2nd to 6th Standard. Talk about sincerity! 

- I am a good cook, and I aspire to retire with a 24x7 bakery/diner in the mountains.

- I am always in the 'panic-zone', meaning that have this constant urge to try out new things, be it ideas, restaurants or ice cream flavors.

- I am not scared of taking risks. That is what brings me the courage to switch from a promising career, and step into Product Management.

# What I do for fun

- Eating (But something new everyday)
- Cooking/Baking (I make amazing Banofee Pie)
- Binge-watching (All time Favorites - Friends, Bojack Horseman, Fleabag, Modern Family, HIMYM)
- Gardening ([watch my garden here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2120UF9EaKE)
- Travel (Mountains over beaches)
- Music (I love good ol' Indie music. Favs- Atif Aslam, Ankur Tewari)
